# Applied Programming

## Task:

The field of the chessboard is determined by a pair of natural numbers, each of which does not exceed eight: the first number is the number of the vertical (when counting from left to right), the second is the number of the horizontal (when counting from bottom to top).

Given natural numbers k, l, m, n, each of which does not exceed eight.


Required:

a) Find out if the fields (k, I) and (m, n) are fields of the same color.

b) On the field (k, I) is a queen, rook, bishop or knight (user must enter). Does it threaten the field (m, n)?

c) Find out whether it is possible to get from the square (k, I) to the square (m, n) with one move of the rook, queen or bishop (must be entered by the user). If not, then find out how it can be done in two moves (indicate the field to which the first move leads).

## Program name:

Chess Task Program

## Description:

The program answers the following questions:

a) Find out if the fields (k, I) and (m, n) are fields of the same color.

b) On the field (k, I) is a queen, rook, bishop or knight (user must enter). Does it threaten the field (m, n)?

c) Find out whether it is possible to get from the square (k, I) to the square (m, n) with one move of the rook, queen or bishop (must be entered by the user). If not, then find out how it can be done in two moves (indicate the field to which the first move leads).

## How to use:

To use the program, you need to follow these steps:
1) Compile the executable file of the program from the source code or use the precompiled version
2) Run the program
3) Enter number
4) Get the execution result

## Comments from the developer:

To develop this program, a development environment called Clion was used.
Compilation was performed using the CMake tool. You can use any development environment to open the main.cpp source code file. For your convenience, in the cmake-build-debug folder you can find a precompiled version of the program.
